# Cartoonify
In this project the final aim is to transform the image into its cartoon form. Thus, we will build a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using OpenCV.

MODULES TO IMPORT:
1)CV2: Imported to use OpenCV for image processing

2)easygui: Imported to open a file box. It allows us to select any file from our system.

3)Numpy: Images are stored and processed as numbers. These are taken as arrays. We use NumPy to deal with arrays.

4)Imageio: Used to read the file which is chosen by file box using a path.

5)Matplotlib: This library is used for visualization and plotting. Thus, it is imported to form the plot of images.

6)OS: For OS interaction. Here, to read the path and save images to that path.
